{"instruction": "What type of SSO implementation is described in this document?", "input": "", "output": "A separated SSO implementation using OktaValve, which exists outside the Incorta jar and has advantages such as not requiring a new build for customer implementations."}
{"instruction": "How does OktaValve check if a user has an active session in Incorta?", "input": "", "output": "It checks if the user has an active session by verifying that there is no existing SAML response attached to the request. If no response exists, it constructs the SAML request and redirects the browser with a 302 status code."}
{"instruction": "What happens when the user submits their username and password successfully in OktaValve?", "input": "", "output": "OktaValve creates a new session for the user by sending a redirect to the SSO URL configured in the Incorta application, which includes the tenant attached and an SAML response. This redirects the browser back to Okta."}
{"instruction": "What is the role of AuthFilter in this process?", "input": "", "output": "It checks if the URL contains the tenant string, indicating that it's from the SSO authentication flow, and verifies that there is a session if not. If no session exists, it checks for an SSO-enabled tenant and logs in using AuthServlet."}
{"instruction": "How does OktaValve handle requests to Incorta after the user logs in?", "input": "", "output": "It passes the user to Incorta using the internal active session created by OktaValve when there is a request without an existing session attached."}

{"instruction": "How does OktaValve handle requests without an existing session attached?", "input": "", "output": "It creates a new session for the user by sending a redirect back to Okta, passing the tenant string and SAML response (if any) to Okta. This redirects the browser back to the Incorta application."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the AuthServlet in this process?", "input": "", "output": "It handles authentication requests to Incorta by extracting the loginName from the request and creating a session for the user with that name, which is then passed to the next layer of authentication (in this case, OktaValve)."}
{"instruction": "How does OktaValve handle multiple requests from the same user to Incorta?", "input": "", "output": "It uses the internal active session created by OktaValve when there is a request without an existing session attached. This ensures that only one session is maintained for each user."}
{"instruction": "What type of errors might occur if OktaValve is not configured correctly or has issues with the SSO implementation?", "input": "", "output": "Errors might include unable to find the tenant string in the URL, incorrect SAML response, or failed authentication attempts by Incorta after a successful login. These would prevent the application from functioning as intended."}
{"instruction": "What are some potential drawbacks of using OktaValve for SSO in this document?", "input": "", "output": "One drawback is that it's not able to use Incorta classes in OktaValve for certain features, such as getting context within the valve.
